# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical implementation notes and step-by-step completion documents from the development process.

## Purpose

These documents capture the development journey but are **not the canonical source of truth**. They are kept for historical reference and context.

## Canonical Documentation

For current architecture, deployment, and operational information, refer to:

- **[../index.md](../index.md)** - Documentation index
- **[../architecture.md](../architecture.md)** - System architecture
- **[../flows.md](../flows.md)** - Application flows
- **[../security.md](../security.md)** - Security model
- **[../deployment.md](../deployment.md)** - Deployment guide

## Contents

### Implementation Phases
- `STEP0_COMPLETE.md` through `STEP5_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation phase completion notes
- `PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_*.md` - Phase implementation status documents

### Code Reviews
- `REVIEW_*.md` - Code review documents and summaries
- `TECH_LEAD_REVIEW*.md` - Technical lead review documents

### Deployment Notes
- `DEPLOYMENT_*.md` - Deployment guides and test results (superseded by `../deployment.md`)
- `DEPLOY_*.md` - Deployment command references
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Infrastructure deployment notes

### Project Overview
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Internal project overview/spec (not public README)
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - High-level project summary
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Implementation status tracking

### Other

## Note

These documents may contain:
- Implementation details that have since changed
- Step-by-step instructions that are no longer current
- Internal notes and decisions that are now documented in ADRs
- Sensitive information (IPs, domains) that should not be in public docs

For current information, always refer to the canonical documentation in `../`.
